# Machine Learning Project - Group 51
This repository contains all the resources for our Machine Learning project aimed at predicting the Workers' Compensation Board (WCB) final decision on the type of injury (Claim Injury Type) that should be granted. It includes our approach, code, reports, and various deliverables created during the project.

 ## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the injury type assigned by the WCB based on historical claim data. We employ a variety of techniques throughout the project lifecycle, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, ensuring the best possible outcome.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized into several folders that contain key information, deliverables, and resources that are explained below:

### üóÇÔ∏è Deliverables
This folder includes the final deliveries for different stages of the project, which are organized as follows:

- Handout: Contains the final submission for the handout phase, including all the used in the handout submission and the final report intended structure.
- Final Project: Contains the final submission for the project, including the code for the machine learning model developed, the code for the interactive predictions interface and the final report that summarizes the entire project, including methodology applied, results and conclusions.

### üìë Description
This folder contains essential guidelines and instructions for each stage of the project, which includes:

- Handout guidelines: Instructions for the initial project submission.
- Final project guidelines: Detailed requirements for the final submission and presentation.

### üí° Ideas for Models
In this folder, we document and store the various model ideas that were considered and explored during the development of the final model. This includes:

- Different algorithms tested.
- Notes on performance, challenges, and model selection criteria.
- Insights gained from each iteration of the model development process.
